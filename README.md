# FirebaseClientApp
CPP code for Google's FireBase Authentication and FireStore Cloud Client Application on MacOS.

In this Client App, I am using Google Firebase Authentication and FireStore features using C++ and QT.

We have a login window (see code in wlogin.cpp, uses Firebase Authentication, see authentication.cpp), mform window (see mform.cpp) to store data on
Firebase FireStore (see dbfirestore.cpp).
